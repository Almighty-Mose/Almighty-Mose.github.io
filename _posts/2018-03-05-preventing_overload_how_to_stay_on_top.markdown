Today I wanted to talk about some strategies I've learned in order to keep myself from feeling overwhelmed.  Let's face it, code is hard. When you're staring down the barrel of a giant project, it's easy to feel overloaded with tasks, goals, and all the code you've yet to write.

This presents a unique challenge for me, because at a young age, I was diagnosed with ADHD. This makes big projects especially difficult for me, as I tend to get overloaded and shut down pretty easily. I jump ahead to everything I haven't yet done, and while my mind is bursting with ideas of how to solve those problems and write that code, the rest of me can't keep up, leading to a feeling of helplessness.  Over the years, I've developed a series of strategies to help myself overcome this challenge and succeed; I'd like to share those.

> First and foremost, it's important to be aware of what causes you to overload.

Oftentimes, I'm so excited to get started that my brain tries to do everything at once!  Of course, I can only type so fast, and actually, my mind sometimes gets so ahead of itself that it stops giving instructions to my body at all, and I quit typing or doing much of anything.  Analysis paralysis!  

That means it's critical to **break things into smaller tasks.** Instead of looking at the project as a whole, look at one class, or focus on one method. On really bad days, just take it line by line. Break the project down to a level that isn't intimidating.  Doing this provides constant feelings of success and progress each time one of those small tasks is completed. 

> Secondly, embrace distraction.  

Our brains, like any other muscle, need recovery periods.  It's important to understand your own brain's endurance, and give it the rest it needs to be productive. If you find yourself struggling to focus, go ahead and take a break.  Let your mind work on another set of problems. If you're working on multiple projects or programs, sometimes switching to a different project is enough of a shift to re-engage your mind. However, I often find that I need to step away from coding as a whole, and take a walk or do something mentally relaxing. **Give your brain time to rest.**  After sitting back down from a break, I find that my productivity goes through the roof. I achieve far more in an hour with a 20 minute break in the middle than by simply working through the whole hour.

That's extra important for a people with ADHD, as our attention goes all over the place. Some days, I can really focus and write tons and tons of code, other days, I can barely get a line, and *that's okay*. I had to come to the realization that I don't fit the 9-5 workday mold. It's more like an hour here, six hours there kind of thing.

This also means setting goals a little differently. Weekly instead of daily time goals are a good strategy. My current goal is roughly 20 hours of code per week. **Work with your brain instead of against it.** If I'm crazy distracted on Monday and can't get any work done, it's all good, I have the whole rest of the week. Other weeks I'll hit 8 hours on Monday. The trick is not judging yourself for the amount of work you do in a day. Any progress is progress. Even one line is more than zero.

> Finally, keep a schedule. 

This goes along with embracing distraction. When I sit down to write code, I track my time using [Toggl](http://toggl.com), a free online time tracking tool. Toggl is crucial for my weekly time goals, as it tells me exactly how much time I spent working on code the last week, broken down by day and project (as long as I remember to start the timer!). Toggl also has a pomodoro timer, which is a timer that alternates between two durations, allowing you to set a "work" and a "break" interval.  **Use pomodoro timers to your advantage!** With ADHD, I often get lost in periods of "hyperfocus", which is where I get locked into one thing to the exclusion of everything else. It's the feeling of being "in the zone" that some people talk about. Sometimes hyperfocus is awesome, like when I'm digging down into a project and really going for it.  Unfortunately, I lose track of time, so my "I only have time to code for an hour" turns into "when did the sun go down?".  It's even worse when this happens on my break! Keeping a schedule using pomodoro timers helps to keep my work and breaks on track, and prevents burnout.

Lots of us have learning disabilities, many of us don't, however, I feel these strategies are applicable to everyone. If you're feeling overwhelmed, use some of these tricks! I hope they'll help you as much as they've helped me.
