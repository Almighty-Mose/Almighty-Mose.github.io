The code we write is an expression, an extension of ourselves. Semi-broken, constantly searching for the extra functionality that makes the program whole. Within our code, we solve, we learn, we grow. As a program grows, it begins to contain vestiges of personality - it takes on a life of its own. The program's writers are reflected in those methods and loops and strings. 

>Through learning code, we learn ourselves.

Code is a medium of expression, an art form.  Clean, solid code takes patience, attention, and dedication.  Learning this medium is difficult, as learning piano is difficult.  A composer can take 88 keys and write a beautiful [symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn1MhSBSzPE); so can we as coders take 96 keyboard characters and write Facebook.

> Software development is the power of creation at your fingertips.

An entire world of code is out there waiting to be explored. Lines upon lines of characters - written and as yet unwritten - waiting for their potential to be unlocked. All one must do is seek it out. Learning code is a journey of 10,000 miles, except the miles don't count down.  Every project, every language, holds some new nugget of knowledge to be learned. As we learn, we better ourselves; abstracting away the unnecessary, refining our processes.  In life as it is in code.
